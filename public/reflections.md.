#   Leigh's Reflection Report :D

# 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.**

* Basic Java script statements - The most simple of functions *in JS*. This includes learning how to print the output and how to display your output in alert boxes.
* Variable Declaration - The holders or containers of data. Its pretty similar to the ones in **c++**.
* While and Do While loops - While loops read the condition first before executing the code. On the other hand, Do While loops execute the code at least once before evaluating the condition. 
* Java script syntax - The set of rules that we should follow so our code would be in the correct structure. It also indicates how we should declare and arrange cammands or operators.
* Java script operators - These allow us to perform formulas or compare other varibles. Examples of these include *Arithmetic Operators* and *Logical Operators*.

# 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

* Functions - Im sure about the syntax but it takes me a **while** to recall when to use these. I was also absent during the discussion so I most likely am a bit behind on this topic.
* Control statements (besides loop) - I often mistype or arrange them wrong when im coding. Making me work even longer on the syntax and losing more time.
* Break - Im not so sure when im supposed to be using this statement. When I do plance it in my code, it ends up producing errors in the syntax.
* Continue - I sometimes forget that continue doesnt end the program and instead just skips one function. ~~Can you tell im running out of ideas to put here? :'(~~
* Commonly Used JavaScript Number Objects - I forgot these even existed and feel a bit dumb when I remember them in the middle of my coding. 

# 3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

I should make more time to practice coding and read more about the functions im least familiar with. I could also consult with ma'am or at least email her when I don't get a specifc topic.


# 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

*Effective*
* Coding tasks - enhances our logical thinking and prepares us for the coding part of the exam.
* Quiz - Concept checking

*Ineffective*
* Kahoot - too fast for me and the internet hates me.
* Activities in github - its kind of hard to use when you are on mobile data or when the internet sucks.
